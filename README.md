# Fruit-Classification
A Simple Fruit Classification model trained on Fruits-360  dataset.
  1) Created a CNN Sequential model using keras trained to identify 131 classes of Fruits.

  2) sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss was used as the umver of classes were large instead of categrical_cross_entropy.
  3) Training Accuracy of 99.67% was achieved and a validation accuracy of 97.80% was achieved.
  4) Confusion Matrix and Classication report were saved.
  5) Best model weights files were saved using callbacks.
